"Data augmentation is a technique used in machine learning to artificially"
" increase the size of training datasets. It creates new data points by "
"applying transformations to existing samples, introducing variations that"
" mimic the natural uncertainty found in the data. This helps to improve "
"the model's generalization and robustness, making it more resilient to "
"noise and variations in real-world scenarios."

":ref:`Transformation <Data transform and identification>` is favourable "
"as it can determine the performance upper bound of subsequent model. "
"According to description about :ref:`feature definition <How we define "
"features>`, a practical type of transformation is able to change original"
" data to its minimal representation of information that contributes to "
"objective-task. Data after augmentation of transformation would be of "
"high :ref:`SNR <SNR>`, then high interpretability and generalization of "
"trained model can be expected."

"The generalization ability of the model is crucial for its performance in"
" real-world applications. The better the generalization ability of the "
"model, the more robust and reliable it will be in practical applications."
" Introducing randomness is common approach to increase the "
"generalization, in not only model frames (e.g. random forest in ensemble "
"learning, random batch computing and node masking of dropout in :ref:`ANN"
" <ANN>`), but also the data self (random sub sampling, zoom-in, rotation "
"etc.)."

"Valid transformation connects key nodes in the processing flow for auto "
"modeling or prediction. For example, automation for thinprep cytologic "
"test (TCT) requires labeling and measuring cells in morphology or "
"structure, for further diagnosis or investigation. (a) in :numref:`Figure"
" %s <immunofluorescence image augmentation>` is an immunofluorescence "
"nuclei image. Automation labeling task is as similar as determining "
"nuclei of hepatocellular carcinoma in :numref:`Figure %s <pathological "

":ref:`Monte Carlo method <Monte Carlo method>` is a numerical technique "
"used to solve complex problems that can hardly be solved analytically. "
"One of its merits is to estimate the expected value of a function or to "
"find the solution to a problem, relying on repeated random sampling."

"Reconsider the analysis after :ref:`pathological image transformation "
"<pathological image statistics>`: it make statistics on distribution for "
"equivalent area of identified nuclei, as shown in :numref:`Figure %s (d) "
"<pathological image statistics>`, however, the transformation cannot be "
"absolutely adaptive in any cases. For example, some reasons such like "
"failure separation cases for overlapped nuclei, or nuclei in possible "
"normal liver tissue are labeled as well (circled within :numref:`Figure "
"%s <mc on pathological image>`), can possibly result in the fat tail of "
"distribution or even outliers appears."

"If a model which is specialized in more accurate estimation for that "
"statistic (average area of nuclei in cancerous cells) with high "
"generalization is desired, building mass of observations via Monte Carlo "
"is in favor. For each random observation, it calculates the number of "
"labeled nuclei, and their average areas within the scope. Samples with "
"cancerous nuclei aggregation unveils its more distinctive pattern, on "
"basis of the corresponding scatter plot for those two statistics on Monte"
" Carlo sampling."

"Extract those samples can be helpful for further statistical modeling in "
"precision. For instance, the profile of histogram for average nucleus "
"area of cancer cell, is of neither fat tail nor appearance of outliers. "
"Therefore the approximate estimation for its standard deviation (37.632),"
" should be more reliable in comparison with the one in :numref:`Figure %s"
" (d) <pathological image statistics>`. Or be more rigorous and "
"comprehensive, compute for its multivariate gaussian distribution "

"As all processing steps above are of physically and statistically "
"interpretable, the obtained model can be expected to be of both high "
"interpretability and high generalization. Moreover, Monte Carlo method "
"can also contribute to increase precision of prediction: mass of random "
"observations can be built in the same manner in area to be predicted as "
"well, through which some atypical signals that have impact on final "
"outcome can be suppressed in probability."
