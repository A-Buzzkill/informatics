" will be replaced. By default, an anchor should be the center of a kernel"
" (otherwise the output image will be biased), however, it is weired to "
"limit all dimensions of kernel as odd numbers. The basic idea in "
"**scipy** is showed in :numref:`Figure %s <anchor in kernel>` which is "
"also applied in informatics, for even number, the anchor in that "
