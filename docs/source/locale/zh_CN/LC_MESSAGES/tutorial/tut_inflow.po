"Most of the analysis occurs in data stored in the file system. The "
"ability to accurately manipulate (primarily loading) these files is an "
"essential skill. Accurately loading and manipulating files improves the "
"overall efficiency of the process, as it ensures that the correct data is"
" being used for analysis, reducing the risk of errors and "
"inconsistencies."

"Engineering implementation of file operations requires good understanding"
" of the file structure and format, as well as size and complexity of the "
"files being analyzed. Large or complex files can pose challenges in terms"
" of processing power, memory usage, and time required for analysis."

"For persistent inflow data, the cost of memory consuming should be under "
"consideration. :numref:`generator function` demonstrates the logic to "
"return a iterable container via two different implemented methods. "
"Compare to the case of :code:`iter2`, :code:`iter1` will increasingly "
"occupy the cache until release after return, which readily results in "
"memory leak if the scale of :code:`cases` is large enough."

"Notably, the tuple comprehension in Python will trigger lazy evaluation. "
"In that case a generator object will be return. From example above, "
":code:`iter3` can be seem as an another equivalent implementation for "
":code:`iter2`."

"For universality, interfaces of search or filtering are designed in form "
"of high-order function. Example of :numref:`file searcher` shows two "
"different pipelines for searching image files with `jpg` or `jpeg` "

"Occasionally files in identical folder needs some kind of uniformed "
"treatment (like using labels as folder names for data with different "
"attributes). Under this circumstance, folder relocation can escape "
"redundant operation on files. Following the :code:`p1` in :numref:`file "
"searcher`, the example implementation in :numref:`folder relocation` "
"shows an operation of reading images located in different file folders "
"named using file format suffix (as shown in :ref:`example right side "
"<file structure for JPG and BMP>`)."
