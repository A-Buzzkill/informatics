"In data analytics, machine learning, or deep learning, approaches to "
"build proper pipes for pre and post processing, are critical steps for "
"determining the ceiling of model performance. Data defined here mainly "
"refers to :math:`n`-dimensional array in computer science (or tensor in "
"mathematics). This tutorial demonstrates image enhancement methods "
"generally applied in computer vision, as well as their upper applications"
" in certain study fields."
