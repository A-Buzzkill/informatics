_`Anomaly and change`
=====================

In the realm of data analysis, anomaly and change detection play pivotal roles in understanding the behavior of
complex systems. Particularly in dynamic environments, where data patterns and distributions constantly shift,
effective anomaly and change detection becomes crucial techniques and methodologies employed for identifying unusual
patterns and significant variations in datasets.

Anomaly detection aims to identify observations that significantly deviate from the expected patterns or the main
distribution of the data. By employing statistical algorithms, detected outliers can be indicative of errors,
novelties, or can provide valuable insight into the underlying system. Change detection, on the other hand, focuses
on identifying significant changes in the statistical properties or patterns of data over time. Such changes might
indicate system failures, external disturbances, or natural evolution of the system. Change detection techniques
range from simple threshold-based approaches to complex statistical tests and machine learning models, depending
on the nature and complexity of the data.
