_`Monte Carlo method`
=====================

Monte Carlo is a powerful technique used to understand and analyze complex systems by generating synthetic data that
mimic real-world processes. It can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By creating
virtual experiments that are difficult or even impossible to study through traditional methods on computer, it provides
approximate solutions to problems that are too intractable to be analyzed mathematically, enables many scientific
and technological breakthroughs in fields such like physics, engineering, finance.
