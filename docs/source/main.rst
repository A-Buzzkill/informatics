_`Welcome to dataflow's Documentation!`
=======================================

**dataflow** is a fast construction utility for data processing pipeline in Python. With this pacakge we
aim to establish:

* a generic tool-kit for data processing, analytics, caching, and visualization;
* an uniform norm for packaging abstract data processing flow, from scripts with varying codes styles;
* an generating and exporting engine for scientific tables and diagrams.

The data to be supported by this platform, mainly targeted for, but not limited to medical images.

**informatics** is a fast construction utility for scientific computation pipeline in Python. With this pacakge
we aim to establish:

* a generic and prototypical AI development-oriented tool-kit for scientific computation, analytics, and data
  visualization;

* an uniform protocol for packaging abstract data processing flow, in order to integrating workflows from varying
  code styles;

* the tutorial materials about numerical computation and mathematical modeling on essential principles, and
  programming practices.

The data to be supported mainly with this platform, targeted for but not limited to `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_
object.
