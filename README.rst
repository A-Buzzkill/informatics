Informatics, sourced from its original meaning: the sciences concerned with gathering, manipulating, storing,
retrieving, and classifying recorded information.

It is designed to enable users to solve complex problems in science, engineering, and other domains efficiently and
accurately. Its powerful capabilities are achieved through a combination of cutting-edge software engineering
techniques and the elegance of Python's functional programming paradigm. The strength of highly modular and extensible
architecture allows users to quickly assemble and customize data processing pipelines to meet their specific needs.
Whether it's data cleaning, transformation, analysis, or visualization, informatics provides a rich set of tools and
functions to facilitate these tasks.

Informatics is built to serve for science as well as engineer domains. It provides ready-made solutions for common
tasks like feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment, and more. Refer the
`documentation <https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/zc-tutorial-template>`_ for a crash course about its essential
ideas.
